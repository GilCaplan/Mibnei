# Data Structures and Algorithms

HW contains files of my solutions to the hw.
The homework is theoretical. The official solution is also included in addition to my solutions.
src contains the code to the programming homework (mini-project), the instructions for that is given. It's building a dynamic 2-3 tree for runners.

Development and analysis of algorithms and data structures. **Topics**:
- Fundamental methods for developing algorithms
- Sorting algorithms and lower bounds on the running time of comparison-based sort
- Basic data structures including stack, queue, heap, binary tree, balanced trees, and hash tables
- Basic algorithms on graphs including scans, distance calculation, and minimum spanning tree construction

This also includes: BFS, DFS, Efficient data structures, recurrences and sorting, order statistics, Bellman Ford, Dijkstra, and MST.
