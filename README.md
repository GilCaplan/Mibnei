# Data Structures and Algorithms

Development and analysis of algorithms and data structures. **Topics**:
- Fundamental methods for developing algorithms
- Sorting algorithms and lower bounds on the running time of comparison-based sort
- Basic data structures including stack, queue, heap, binary tree, balanced trees, and hash tables
- Basic algorithms on graphs including scans, distance calculation, and minimum spanning tree construction

This also includes: BFS, DFS, Efficient data structures, recurrences and sorting, order statistics, Bellman Ford, Dijkstra, and MST.
